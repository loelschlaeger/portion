The `{portion}` `R` package offers convenient tools to extract data portions from various objects:

1. works for `vector`, `matrix`, `data.frame`, and `list` objects

2. the relative portion size can be selected

3. allows to extract first, last, random, similar or dissimilar data

4. can portion row- and column-wise

5. provides selected indices as an attribute

## Installation

You can install the released version from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r, install released, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("portion")
```

## Example

Can portion a `vector`:

```{r, vector example}
x <- c(1:4, 16:20)
portion(x, proportion = 0.5, how = "similar")
portion(x, proportion = 0.4, how = "dissimilar")
```

Can portion a `matrix`:

```{r, matrix example}
x <- matrix(LETTERS[1:24], nrow = 4)
portion(x, proportion = 0.5, how = "first")
portion(x, proportion = 0.5, how = "first", byrow = FALSE)
```

Can portion a `data.frame`:

```{r, data.frame example}
x <- as.data.frame(diag(8))
portion(x, proportion = 0.3, how = "random")
portion(x, proportion = 0.3, how = "random", byrow = FALSE)
```

Can work on a `list`:

```{r, list example}
x <- list(1:5, diag(3), data.frame(1:3, 2:4))
portion(x, proportion = 0.5, how = "last")
```
